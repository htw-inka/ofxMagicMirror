/**
 * Defines a simple interface for multi-marker tracking with ARToolKitPlus
 *  ARToolKit::TrackerMultiMarker provides all methods to access ARToolKit for
 *  multi marker tracking without needing to mess around with it directly.
 *
 *  Per default the tracker searches for Id-based markers with normal border and uses
 *  the RPP algorithm for pose estimation.
 *  Furthermore it uses only 4 'good' points of the convex hull to do the pose estimation.
 *  You can override this using the according methods.
