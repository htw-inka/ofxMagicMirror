 * Defines a simple interface for single-marker tracking with ARToolKitPlus

 *
 *  Per default the tracker searches for Id-based markers with normal border and uses
 *  the RPP algorithm for pose estimation. You can override this using the according methods.

 *  If you need multi-marker tracking use TrackerMultiMarker.
